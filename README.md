# Space-Mission
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>In this powerbi dashboard I have created, a total space mission is considered by different space companies from 1960 to 2020, including the number of successful launches, the cost of each mission, and the types of spacecraft used. Additionally, it also includes information on the countries and private companies that have contributed to the space industry during this time period. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of space exploration over the past 60 years.<h4>
